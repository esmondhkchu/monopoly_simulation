# Monopoly Simulation

This project simulates a standard Monopoly game with two d-sided dices by two approaches: n tuns simulation and non-parametric bootstrap (ie. random sampling with replacement); this project also compares the pros and cons of these two methods, namely speed and accuracy.

This project was originally assigned to be done in R. I have also replicate the project in Python.
